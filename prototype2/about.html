        <p>I began this project after I purchased a cricut machine to make things for my family and I. My friends began expressing interest
            in custom items for them and their families. I have since experimented with using my cricut cutter to make many different items
            such as shirts, etched glasses, wooden and canvas signs, can and bottle sleeves, and vinyl decals, to name a few. 
            Since I work alone, I can handle most projects, unless they are high volume projects with tough time constraints. Contact me with your ideas and we can get started!
