        <div id="pic1" class="blurb left">I can provide services for sports team apparel, customized
            to the individual. This could be for any sports team, from varsity football to beer league softball. These make excellent
            gifts for parents, relatives, and friends who love to support their favorite athletes.
        </div>
        <div id="pic2" class="blurb right">I can create customized adhesive vinyl decals for companies or any individual needs. 
            These can be made from any vector graphic, and can be cut from regular vinyl or 6-year outdoor vinyl, which holds up well 
            against the elements and is great for bumper or window stickers. 
        </div>
        <div id="pic3" class="blurb left2">I can create intimate household decorations for gifts such as wedding gifts, housewarming gifts, or anniversary gifts,
            to name a few. These are very flexible with the design and fonts of the lettering, depending on the function of the 
            sign. These make great additions to the home, whether as a weathered welcome sign or an intimate home decoration hung 
            on the mantle.
